# Boost Your Workflow, Not Replace It: Using AI to Enhance Developer Productivity

As a principal engineer, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how teams build software—not just *what* they build, but *how* they get there. Over the years, one pattern keeps showing up: developers lose too much time to repetition.

Writing boilerplate. Managing commits. Fixing linter issues. Drafting pull requests. Initializing yet another repository. These things matter, but they’re not why any of us got into programming. They interrupt flow, slow momentum, and chip away at the creative rhythm that makes development satisfying.

That realization led me down a simple line of thought:
What if AI could take care of the repetitive parts, without pulling us out of the tools and workflows we already use?


### The Problem with “AI-First” Tools

AI is everywhere now, and that’s great. But most of the tools built around it assume developers want to *move*—to new editors, new environments, or entirely new ways of working.

That’s where the friction starts. Switching tools means losing context. It breaks habits and slows adoption. And when AI feels like something you have to *work around*, it stops helping.


### Enhancing Workflows Without Replacing Developers

The goal wasn’t to reinvent development. It was to enhance it.
Automate what’s repetitive. Standardize what’s already solved. Keep everything else in the developer’s hands.

Here’s what that looks like in practice:

#### Automating Commits

Commit messages are necessary but often tedious. AI can take a quick look at your staged changes and generate something clean and conventional in seconds.

```bash
# Generate logical grouped conventional commits for the staged changes
git ai commit
# Output: "feat(auth): add OAuth2 token refresh logic"

```

#### Drafting Pull Requests

PRs are another time sink. They don’t have to be.

```bash
git ai pr
# AI suggests a PR title and description summarizing the changes and impact
```

#### Handling Boilerplate

Starting new projects shouldn’t slow you down.

```bash
# Initialize a new Python project with standard structure
git ai init --language python --project "auth-service"
```

#### Merging branches

Your day shouldn't be spent resolving merge conflicts.

```bash
git ai merge origin/main
```

These automations remove friction, letting developers focus on solving problems rather than formatting them.


### Team Benefits and Philosophy

The impact extends beyond individual productivity. Standardized commits, PR content, and automated linter fixes help teams stay aligned and move faster. Developers can focus on delivering value and shipping features, leaving creativity intact.

AI should amplify human capability, not replace it. Handle the repetitive, standard tasks automatically, and keep the complex, creative work in human hands.


### Try It Yourself

If this resonates, take a look at **[Git AI](https://github.com/mattstruble/git-ai)**. It’s a small utility I built to bring these ideas into practice. Drop it into your workflow and see how it feels.

> **Note:** Git AI is still in alpha. I’d love to hear your feedback and ideas for improvement.
