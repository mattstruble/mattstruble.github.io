My name is Matt Struble, and I am a  Machine Learning and Computer Vision engineer.

Software first impacted my life at a very young age with video games. I knew from then that I wanted to create that same wonder and inspiration I experienced growing up. Being able to impact reality always seemed like a distant dream, until my first programming class in High School. There, I realized that I could make my dream into a reality, and that I wanted nothing more than to continually focus my skills towards creating a lasting impact on the world.

I started out with a degree in Game Programming, and a minor in Mathematics, which exposed me to building large high-performance software packages. Pretty regularly I’m able to apply game programming patterns to enterprise code bases to improve both scalability and performance. Now with a Masters in Machine Learning and Robotics, the opportunity to create new experiences for others is everywhere. Whether it’s analyzing data, developing intelligent models, or creating quick apps to make my friends laugh, I’m continually working towards improving my skills and creating a positive impact for others.

I strive to maintain as much of my digital privacy as possible, and to help educate others by documenting my journey. The
software I write always has the users privacy and ethics at the forefront, without compromise.

On this website I aim to share my thoughts and notes on things I'm excited about and working on. I hope to connect with people having
a similar mindset.
