# **About Me** 

My name is **{{ site.author.name }}**, and I am a Machine Learning and Computer Vision engineer. <br> 

Software first impacted my life at a very young age with video games. I knew from then that I wanted to create that same wonder and inspiration I experienced growing up. Being able to impact reality always seemed like a distant dream, until my first programming class in High School. There, I realized that I could make my dream into a reality, and that I wanted nothing more than to continually focus my skills towards creating a lasting impact on the world.

I started out with a degree in Game Programming, and a minor in Mathematics, which exposed me to building large high-performance software packages. Pretty regularly I’m able to apply game programming patterns to enterprise code bases to improve both scalability and performance. Now with a Masters in Machine Learning and Robotics, the opportunity to create new experiences for others is everywhere. Whether it’s analyzing data, developing intelligent models, or creating quick apps to make my friends laugh, I’m continually working towards improving my skills and creating a positive impact for others.
