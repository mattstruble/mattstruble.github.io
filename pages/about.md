# **About Me** 

My name is **{{ site.author.name }}**, and I am a Machine Learning and Computer Vision engineer. <br> 

I was first introduced to the way software could have a positive impact on life at a very young age with video games. I wanted to grow up and craft my own unique experiences to share with the world, in order to provide the same wonder and inspiration I experienced growing up. Being able to impact reality always seemed like a distant dream, up until my first programming class in High School. It was during that class where I realized I could make my dream into a reality, that I wanted nothing more than to continually focus my skills towards creating a lasting impact on the world. 

I started out with a degree in Game Programming, and a minor in Mathematics, which exposed me to building large high-performance software packages. Pretty regularly I'm able to apply game programming patterns to enterprise code bases to improve both scalability and performance. Now with a Masters in Machine Learning and Robotics, I am constantly finding new opportunities to combine my passions to create new experiences for others. Whether it's analyzing data, developing intelligent models, or creating quick apps to make my friends laugh, I'm continually working towards improving my skills and creating a positive impact for others. 

The future of artificial intelligence is now and I am excited to be a part of inspiring future generations to come.
